# Simple Physics Engine (Raylib)
This is a school project demonstrating a basic 2D physics engine built using the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) graphics library. It includes simple physics simulations such as motion, gravity, collisions, and damping.

## Features

- Basic 2D rigid body physics
- Velocity and acceleration
- Gravity simulation
- Collision detection including window bounds
- Damping for motion control
- Simple rendering with raylib
